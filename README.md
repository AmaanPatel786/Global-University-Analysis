Project Overview
The Global University Analytics Success Dashboard provides an in-depth look at global higher education trends. Leveraging Power BI, it translates complex datasets into interactive visuals that assess university performance across countries, empowering educators, students, and policymakers with valuable insights to track academic trends and make informed decisions.

🎯 Objectives
Our project is designed with the following objectives in mind:

University Rankings: Analyze and compare global university rankings to reveal the distribution of high-performing institutions across regions.
Critical Success Factors: Identify key factors like faculty-student ratios, international student ratios, and research impact that influence university success.
Regional Insights: Dive into regional trends to uncover national education system strengths and areas for improvement.
📊 Dataset Details
Our analysis utilized a comprehensive dataset including:

Countries: A list of representative countries covered by each ranking system.
Universities: Universities linked to specific countries and ranking data.
Ranking Systems: Times Higher Education, Shanghai Ranking, and CWUR, each with unique metrics such as citations, quality of education, and research output.
Ranking Criteria: Metrics contributing to each institution’s score.
Yearly Metrics: Statistics on student numbers, faculty-student ratios, and rankings over time.
🛠️ Data Preprocessing
To ensure accuracy and relevance, we processed the data through:

Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized university and country names.
Data Transformation: Created new metrics, such as student success rates and faculty-to-student ratios, to capture key trends.
Data Reduction: Filtered unnecessary columns to enhance dashboard performance, focusing on critical variables like university rankings, research output, and graduation rates.
📈 Dashboard Views
🌎 Country Analysis
Highlights top-performing countries in higher education, with the U.S., U.K., Australia, Germany, and Canada leading in international student enrollment. Countries like South Korea, Turkey, and Israel demonstrate significant gender diversity.

🎓 University Analysis
Analyzes institutions such as Arizona State University, University of Massachusetts, and University of Toronto, which lead in student numbers, alongside universities with high international student ratios and optimal student-staff ratios.

📊 Ranking Analysis
Compares ranking systems—CWUR, Times Higher Education, and Shanghai Ranking—across metrics like gender diversity and student-staff ratios. CWUR ranks the highest number of universities, while Times Higher Education has the best student-staff ratio.

📆 Yearly Analysis
Tracks educational growth, gender diversity, and enrollment trends across years, highlighting peaks and declines. Findings show increased female student enrollment through 2016 and significant university expansion after 2012.

🔍 Key Insights
Diversity & International Appeal: High-ranking universities attract more international students and maintain favorable student-staff ratios.
Gender Representation: A positive correlation exists between ranking scores and female student percentages, underscoring the role of gender diversity in higher education.
Growth Trends: From 2006 to 2016, international student percentages rose significantly, peaking in 2014 and 2015.
🎤 Presentation
We showcased this project at SDBI, where we presented the dashboard’s capabilities and its impact on data-driven decision-making in academia. The positive response affirmed its potential as a powerful tool for educational stakeholders.

Conclusion
The Global University Success Analysis Dashboard enhances our understanding of global education systems by highlighting critical success factors and trends that shape university performance. This project is a practical example of how data visualization can transform complex information into meaningful insights.
